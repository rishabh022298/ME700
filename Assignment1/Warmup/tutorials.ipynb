    "### Population dynamics\n",
    "The prediction of population growth over time of any species is a very complex task as it depends upon numerous factors like availability of resources, existence of predators, climate, unknown weather phenomenons, etc. A good amount of research has been done to develop the models for understanding the population dynamics of different species. One of most popular equation associated with population growth is ***logistic eqution***. It looks like:\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}N}{\\mathrm{d}t} = rN\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K}\\right)$$\n",
    "where, $N$ is the population, $r$ is the intrinsic growth rate and $K$ is the carrying capacity of the environment. Here $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}N}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\dot{N}$ represent the rate of change of population with time. Now, it is extremely difficult to find the solution $N(t)$ of the above equation. But we can at least predict what the population will be when it reaches the equilibrium. This can be done by finding the fixed point of the given differential equation.\\\n",
    "Let's take an arbitrary example where $r = 1$ and $K = 1,000,000$. Clearly, population cannot be negative and a quick inspection of the R.H.S. will tell us that $N = 0$ is a fixed point. But we are seeking a non trivial solution. So, let's take the interval $[1,10000000]$ for finding the population at an equilibrium point.\\\n",
